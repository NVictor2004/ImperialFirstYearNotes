# Imperial First Year Notes
These are my notes for the First Year of the Imperial College London 2023 - 2027 Computing MEng course. 

I did not make notes for Computer Systems or Databases, however, notes for all other examined courses are present and complete.

These notes were created using Obsidian, and compiled to PDF using the Obsidian community plugin Better Export PDF.
